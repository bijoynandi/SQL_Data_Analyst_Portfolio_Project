# Project Title

SQL Data Analyst Portfolio Project

# Project Description

This repository contains a collection of SQL queries and projects that showcase my skills as a data analyst. The projects cover a range of topics, including database exploration, dimension exploration, date exploration, measure exploration, magnitude analysis, ranking analysis, change over time analysis, cumulative analysis, performance analysis, part-to-whole analysis, data segmentation, and at the end there are two detailed reports for customers and products that covers all the core requirements for getting the insights out the data and take better business decisions.

SQL queries? Check them out here: [scripts](scripts)

# Database Exploration

This section contains SQL queries that explore the structure and contents of the database. It includes queries for retrieving table information and column information.

# Dimension Exploration

This section contains SQL queries that explore the dimensions of the database. It includes queries for retrieving dimension information, such as dimension tables, dimension attributes, and dimension relationships.

# Date Exploration

This section contains SQL queries that explore the dates in the database. It includes queries for retrieving date information, such as date dimensions, date attributes, and date relationships.

# Measure Exploration

This section contains SQL queries that explore the measures in the database. It includes queries for retrieving the total sales, items sold, average selling price, total number of orders, and total number of customers, total number of products and many more.

# Magnitude Analysis

This section contains SQL queries that analyze the magnitude of the data. It includes queries for retrieving total customers by countries, customers by gender, total products by categories, average cost of categories, total revenue generated by each customer and more.

# Ranking Analysis

This section contains SQL queries that analyze the ranking of the data. It includes queries for retrieving which 5 products generate the highest revenue, using the Window function to find the top products by revenue, 5 worst performing products by revenue, top 10 customers who have generated the highest revenue, 3 customers with fewest orders placed etc.

# Change Over Time Analysis

This section contains SQL queries that analyze the change over time in the data. It includes queries for retrieving the total sales by year, sales changes over months, changes over year and specific month of the year.

# Cumulative Analysis

This section contains SQL queries that analyze the cumulative data. It includes queries for retrieving the cumulative sales over time, moving average of sales over time.

# Performance Analysis

This section contains SQL queries that analyze the performance of the data. It includes query that analyzes the yearly performance of products by comparing each products sales to both its average sales performance and its previous year's sales.
Another query tha analyzes the monthly performance of products by comparing each products sales 
to both its average sales performance and its previous month's sales.

# Part-to-Whole Analysis

This section contains SQL queries that analyze the part-to-whole relationship in the data. It includes queries for retrieving which categories contribute the most to overall sales?

# Data Segmentation

This section contains SQL queries that segment the data. It includes query that segment products into cost ranges and count how many products fall into each segment.

# Customer Report

## Purpose:
This report consolidates key customer metrics and behaviors.

## Highlights:
1. Gather essential fields such as names, ages, and transaction details.
2. Segment customers into categories (VIP, Regular, and New) and age groups.
3. Aggregate customer-level metrics:
    - Total Orders
    - Total Sales
    - Total Quantity Purchased
    - Total Products
    - Lifespan (In Months)
4. Calculate valuable KPIs:
    - Recency (Months Since Last Order)
    - Average Order Value (AOV)
    - Average Monthly Spending

This report consolidates key product metrics and behaviors.

## Highlights:
1. Gather essential fields such as product name, category, subcategory and cost.
2. Segment Products by revenue to identify High-Performers, Mid-Range, or Low-Performers.
3. Aggregate product-level metrics:
    - Total Orders
    - Total Sales
    - Total Quantity Sold
    - Total Customers (Unique)
    - Lifespan (In Months)
4. Calculate valuable KPIs:

# What I Learned

1. **Database Exploration**: Exploring the database schema and understanding the relationships between tables is crucial for effective data analysis.
2. **Data Exploration**: Exploring data using SQL queries is a powerful way to understand data patterns and relationships.
3. **Analytics and Reporting**: I learned how to use SQL for data analytics and generate reports and dashboards.

# Conclusion

In conclusion, this project has provided a comprehensive overview of how SQL can be used for data analysis. By following the steps outlined in this README, you can extract valuable insights from any type of data and make informed decisions based on the insights gained from the analysis of your data warehouse by using SQL. Remember, the key to successful data analysis is to understand your data, ask the right questions, and use the right tools. SQL is a powerful tool for data analysis, and with the right approach, you can unlock the full potential of your data. Feel  free to modify and adapt the SQL queries to suit your specific project needs. Happy analyzing!
